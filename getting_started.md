Pipeline Engineer can currently be downloaded from the [repository](https://github.com/pipelineengineer/pipelineEngineerPlugin) and placed into your QGIS plugin folder (usually C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins).

Right from installation, you will have access to many different functionalities Pipeline Engineer has to offer.

In order to perform hydraulic modelling with Pipeline Engineer however, you will need to install pandapipes in your QGIS Python environment.

The easiest way to do this is to run the following command in the OSGeo4W Shell:

```bash
pip install pandapipes
```

This will install pandapipes along with all it's dependancies.
